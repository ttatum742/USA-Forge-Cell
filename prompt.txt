Today's tasks are as follows:

1) Looking at the visualization of the die scan results, I see that we need to have a tighter constraint on what is an outer or inner edge. The most recent die scan results seem to indicate that if we were correctly classifying the edges, the circle center calculation would be spot on. How are we determining what is an inner or outer edge right now? How can we more accurately classify the edges?
