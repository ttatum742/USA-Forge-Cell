I have changed things around a little bit. I reverted the changes we have made to the 5pass program back to when the x pass works. I kept our changed program in diescanner_keyence_db.py, and the unchanged program in dieScanner_keyence_dbGoodcalc.py. Keep making changes to diescanner_keyence_db.py going forward. Here's what I need you to do:

-Fix the class error shown in err.txt
-Diescanner_keyence_db.py is still moving us way too far in +x when starting the initial x-pass scan. It looks like it started somewhere around 85-95mm away from the actual die center. The program was aborted early, so there is no data to review. Come up with a plan to fix this issue. 
-The spiral scanning is eating up a TON of time. Come up with a plan to reduce the time spent scanning without affecting the calculation accuracy.
