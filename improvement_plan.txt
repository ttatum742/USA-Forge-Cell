# Die Scanning Accuracy Improvement Plan

## Problem Analysis
Current accuracy: ~5mm error, need ±1mm accuracy. Reducing step size from 1mm to 0.25mm only improved error from 5.7mm to 5.0mm, indicating systematic issues beyond sampling resolution.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Edge Detection Limitations
- **Fixed threshold (2.0mm)** may miss subtle edges or create false positives
- **Simple height differential** doesn't account for noise or gradual transitions
- **Limited edge validation** - no verification that detected edges form a coherent circle

### 2. Scanning Pattern Issues
- **5-pass linear pattern** may miss optimal edge points around a circular die
- **Y-direction only scanning** limits edge detection to specific orientations
- **Starting position bias** - scan starts at +5" offset, may miss best edges

### 3. Center Calculation Algorithm
- **Least squares circle fitting** assumes all edge points are equally valid
- **No outlier removal** - bad edge points heavily influence final result
- **Simple averaging methods** don't weight edge quality or confidence

### 4. Mechanical/Sensor Issues
- **Robot positioning accuracy** may contribute systematic error
- **Sensor calibration drift** over time
- **Vibration/settling** during rapid moves between scan points

## Proposed Improvements (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Enhanced Edge Detection (High Impact)
1. **Adaptive Edge Thresholds**
   - Implement dynamic threshold based on local height variance
   - Add gradient-based edge detection (not just absolute difference)
   - Multi-point edge confirmation (require 2-3 consecutive points)

2. **Edge Quality Scoring**
   - Rate edge quality based on sharpness, consistency, and confidence
   - Filter out low-quality edges before center calculation
   - Add edge direction analysis for circular consistency

### Phase 2: Improved Scanning Strategy (Medium Impact)
3. **Circular/Spiral Scanning Pattern**
   - Replace linear passes with circular scanning around estimated center
   - Add preliminary center estimation from coarse scan
   - Focus detailed scanning on areas near estimated edges

4. **Multi-Direction Edge Validation**
   - Scan both X and Y directions at edge locations
   - Cross-validate edges found in perpendicular directions
   - Add radial scanning from center outward

### Phase 3: Advanced Center Calculation (Medium Impact)
5. **Robust Circle Fitting**
   - Implement RANSAC algorithm to remove outlier edge points
   - Use weighted least squares with edge quality scores
   - Add multiple fitting methods with consensus voting

6. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Initial coarse center estimate → focused re-scanning → refined center
   - Adaptive scan density based on edge uncertainty
   - Secondary validation scan around calculated center

### Phase 4: System Calibration (Lower Impact)
7. **Enhanced Calibration**
   - Multi-point sensor calibration with known reference objects
   - Robot positioning accuracy verification and correction
   - Systematic error characterization and compensation

8. **Real-time Quality Monitoring**
   - Track edge detection consistency across scans
   - Alert for sensor drift or mechanical issues
   - Automatic recalibration triggers

## Implementation Strategy
- **Week 1**: Phase 1 - Enhanced edge detection algorithms
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 - Circular scanning pattern 
- **Week 3**: Phase 3 - Advanced center calculation
- **Week 4**: Phase 4 - System calibration improvements

## Expected Results
- **Phase 1**: 2-3mm accuracy improvement (primary impact)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2mm additional improvement 
- **Phase 3**: 0.5-1mm additional improvement
- **Combined**: Target ±1mm accuracy achieved

This systematic approach addresses the fundamental limitations in edge detection, scanning strategy, and mathematical algorithms rather than just increasing sampling density.
